# software-defined-routing
Demonstrates software defined routing using the distance vector protocol to update forwarding tables between routers.  
  
**NOTE: Controller Program was not written by me. This program virtualizes a controller used for SDN routing. It sends and receives messages from the routers via a TCP socket communication.
